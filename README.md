# rustmerkle


An implementation of a [Merkle Tree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merkle_tree)
data structure in Rust using the SHA256 cryptographic hashing algorithm with
builtin defense against second-preimage attacks.


A Merkle tree allows for efficient and secure verification of the contents of large data structures. This implementation provides APIs to perform 
the fundamental operation on Merkle trees such as providing a Merkle root, generating proof and verify them.
